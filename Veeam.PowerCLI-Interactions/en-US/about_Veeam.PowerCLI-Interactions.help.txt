LONG DESCRIPTION
        This PowerShell Module enables you to interact via VMware PowerCLI with the Veeam Backup & Replication PowerShell Cmdlets.

                * Get-VeeamProtection

RUNNING  Veeam.PowerCLI-Interactions

        There are several commands provided by the Veeam.PowerCLI-Interactions module, those are:

        Get-VeeamProtection     -myVMs

        Start-VeeamQuickBackup  -myVMs

        Start-VeeamRestore      -myVMs

        Add-VeeamJobObject      -myVMs -JobName

        Remove-VeeamJobObject   -myVMs -JobName

        Before you get started with the Functions of the module you need to connect a vCenter Server
        and a Veeam Backup & Replication Server.

        PS C:\> Connect-VIServer -Server <Your vCenter Server>

        PS C:\> Connect-VBRServer -Server <Your vCenter Server>

        To identify the VM Objects the vCenter Connection must match Veeam Configuration for the vCenter.
